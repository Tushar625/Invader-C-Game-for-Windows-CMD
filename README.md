# Invader-C-Game-for-Windows-CMD

It is a simple game made in C. It was the first game I made. It runs in Windows Command Prompt and has a simple Text Based Graphics.
The header files included here, were made to do lot more than what I have used here, that's why they are very large. It was more like
a practice project, I took the idea from "https://youtu.be/3dYMnPYPTS0?si=AOOFkH-qumIGlL3K", Learned about some win32 api functions from
stack overflow and designed a complex data structure, involving doubly linked lists and arrays, to make this game. I did not copy the
code from afore mentioned video. The input and collision detection system I designed, works great.
